## What this repository is

`rustdesk-api` — a self-hosted **API server for the RustDesk remote-desktop client**
(address book, device/user management, login/OIDC/LDAP, audit logs, web admin, web client).

Built in **PHP 8.5 / Laravel 13**, **English** throughout, with a from-scratch **HTML +
jQuery + Bootstrap 5** dark dashboard (no Vue). It began as a port of an earlier Go server,
which has been **retired** now that the PHP app reached and exceeded parity (the repo is now
single-stack PHP).

## Build & test (Docker toolchain — host has no Composer/Node)

```bash
# one-time: build the toolchain image (PHP 8.5 + Composer + Node + Playwright + linters)
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile.toolchain -t rustdesk-api-php-toolchain .

# dev stack (app + MariaDB + Mailpit)
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml up -d
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml run --rm app composer install
docker compose -f docker/compose.dev.yml run --rm app php artisan migrate

# quality gates (run inside the toolchain image)
docker run --rm -v "$PWD":/app -w /app rustdesk-api-php-toolchain bash -lc \
  'php artisan test && ./vendor/bin/pint --test && npx playwright test'
```

## Non-negotiables
- **No Vue / SPA frameworks.** Admin UI = Blade + jQuery + Bootstrap 5 + original CSS.
- **English everywhere**, including identifiers, comments, and docs.
- **Wire-compatibility:** never rename the JSON keys / API paths the RustDesk client speaks
  (see the contract doc). English renames apply to PHP identifiers, not the wire protocol.
- Follow the **wrap-up protocol** in [AGENT.md](AGENT.md): log every change to
  [DevOps/logs/agent-changelog.md](DevOps/logs/agent-changelog.md).
