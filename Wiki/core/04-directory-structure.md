## 📍 Path Mapping Rules

- **`src/components/`**: Only pure reusable UI elements without business domain logic.
- **`src/features/`**: Feature-specific view directories containing page shells, subcomponents, and local hooks.
- **`src/utils/`**: Pure functional code (input-to-output), free of UI dependencies.
- **`DevOps/backlog/`**: Master project backlog index and individual feature backlog plans.
- **`DevOps/archive-plans/`**: Completed and closed implementation plans.
