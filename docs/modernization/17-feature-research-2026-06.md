# 17 · Feature Research — what to build next (2026-06-22)

A fresh sweep of the RustDesk client contract ([02](02-client-api-contract.md)), the Pro
catalog ([03](03-pro-feature-catalog.md)), and the earlier opportunity deep-dive
([11](11-client-feature-opportunities.md)) **after** the latest build wave. Most of doc 11 has
now shipped — this doc captures what is *genuinely still open*, ranks it, and recommends a
shortlist.

> Ratings: **Value** ★ low → ★★★ high · **Effort** S/M/L/XL · **Client-ready?** = stock clients
> already speak it, so server-side work alone unlocks it.

## Just shipped (context)

Strategy/Settings push · preset auto-registration + `--assign` + default device group ·
force-disconnect / Live Sessions · client **and** admin 2FA · SMTP + email verification ·
device deploy/approval · session-recording upload · alarms + connection/file/console audit ·
granular access control + Admin Roles · OIDC · LDAP · RustDesk-client-style address-book

## Correction — `is_pro` is **not** a feature we need to build

An earlier draft of this doc recommended advertising an `is_pro` capability flag so the client
would unlock Pro UI. Verifying against the client source
([`src/hbbs_http/sync.rs`](file:///d:/git/rustdesk/src/hbbs_http/sync.rs)) shows that was wrong:

- `is_pro()` is **inferred, not advertised**. The client's `PRO` flag starts `false` and flips
  to `true` when the server answers the sysinfo handshake — `POST /api/sysinfo` returning
  `"SYSINFO_UPDATED"` (sync.rs:219), or `/api/sysinfo_ver` responding (sync.rs:195).
- **Our server already implements both** (`SystemController::sysinfo` + `/api/sysinfo_ver`), so a
  logged-in device that uploads sysinfo already makes the client treat us as Pro.
- What `is_pro()` actually gates is small (e.g. `hide_cm` in `ipc.rs`). The big Pro **panels**
  (shared address-book tab, etc.) are driven by their own API responses
  (`/api/ab/shared/profiles`, now populated), not by a single pro flag.

Lesson reaffirmed: verify client-facing assumptions against `D:\git\rustdesk` parser/source code
before scheduling work — the same discipline that fixed the `extra:{}` and empty-ack bugs.

## #1 (done) — `/api/v1` write coverage

The genuinely high-value item was making the read-only REST API two-way. Shipped 2026-06-22:

- `PUT /api/v1/devices/{id}` — reassign owner / device group / strategy / alias (`devices.write`).
- `POST` + `PUT /api/v1/strategies[/{id}]` — create/update a strategy's options, bumping
  `modified_at` so the heartbeat pushes it (`strategies.write`).
- `POST` + `PUT /api/v1/users[/{id}]` — provision/update accounts (`users.write`).
- `POST /api/v1/address-books` + `DELETE /api/v1/address-books/{id}` — book CRUD (`address_book.write`).

## Suggested sequencing (remaining)

1. ~~Webhook delivery log + retry (#3) and CSV export (#4)~~ — **done 2026-06-22**: every webhook
   send is now recorded (`webhook_deliveries`), failures retry with exponential backoff via
   `php artisan webhooks:retry` (scheduled every 5 min) or a manual **Resend**; devices + the
   three audit logs each export to CSV honouring the active filter.
2. ~~metrics/observability (#5), per-AB quotas (#7), bulk user actions (#6)~~ — **done
   2026-06-23**: a token-gated Prometheus `/metrics` endpoint, a server-wide per-AB peer cap
   (`RUSTDESK_AB_MAX_PEERS`) enforced on every write path + advertised via `ab/settings`, and
   enable/disable/set-group/delete bulk actions on the Users list.
3. ~~AB import/export (#6 follow-up), API-key hardening (#13), audit retention (#14)~~ — **done
   2026-06-23**.
4. ~~per-book quota overrides~~ · ~~SSO provider presets (#12, Keycloak-first)~~ · ~~richer
   in-console metric trends (#5: a 14-day **Connections + New-devices** activity chart and a
   period-over-period delta on the Sessions card)~~ — all **done 2026-06-23**. The doc-17
   backlog is now exhausted of clean server-side wins; further work is net-new product scope.

## Correction — Wake-on-LAN is **not** a server feature

Verifying against client source: RustDesk's WoL is entirely **client-local**. The peer-card
"WOL" action calls `mainWol(id)` → `main_wol` → `crate::lan::send_wol(id)`
([flutter_ffi.rs:2173](file:///d:/git/rustdesk/src/flutter_ffi.rs#L2173),
[lan.rs:86](file:///d:/git/rustdesk/src/lan.rs#L86)), which reads the **controlling machine's
own** `LanPeers` discovery cache for the MAC and broadcasts the magic packet from there. The API
server is never contacted — there is no endpoint, heartbeat hint, or relay. So there is no
wire-compatible server feature to build; a server-initiated WoL would be non-standard and only
work when the API host shares the target's L2 broadcast domain. De-scoped. (Same lesson as the
`is_pro` correction: verify against `D:\git\rustdesk` before scheduling client-facing work.)

## Correction — "override" (locked) settings can't be pushed by a self-hosted server

The advanced-settings docs describe **default** vs **override** settings. Verified against client
source how each is delivered:

- **Heartbeat strategy** (`StrategyOptions{config_options, extra}`, `sync.rs`): the client applies
  only `config_options`, via `handle_config_options` → `Config::set_options` — i.e. **soft
  defaults the user can still change**. `extra` is deserialized but **ignored**. There is no
  heartbeat path that sets the locked `OVERWRITE_SETTINGS`.
- **Locked overrides** come only from the baked **custom-client config** (`custom.txt`): the
  `default-settings` / `override-settings` sections feed `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` / `OVERWRITE_SETTINGS`
  (`common.rs::read_custom_client`). Critically that blob is `sign::verify`'d against a **hardcoded
  RustDesk public key** (`5Qbwsde3unUcJBtrx9ZkvUmwFNoExHzpryHuPUdqlWM=`), so **only RustDesk's
  official custom-client generator can sign it** — a self-hosted/OSS server cannot forge override
  settings, and we must not pretend to (same lesson as `is_pro`).

**OSS-equivalent lockdown** (what we *can* do, all already in the catalog): push the setting as a
default via a strategy, then push the matching `hide-*-settings` + `disable-change-*` and set
`allow-remote-config-modification = N` so the user can't reach/alter it. The strategy editor now
states this inline.

## Guardrails (unchanged)

- **Wire-compatibility:** never rename the JSON keys / paths the client speaks; validate any new
  client-facing shape against `D:\git\rustdesk` parser code, not secondary docs.
- **No Vue/SPA**, English everywhere, log every change to the agent changelog.
- Each item ships with PHPUnit (and Playwright where it touches the console), Pint + PHPStan L5
  green.
