# 🗺️ @docs Architecture Blueprint

This document defines the **Documentation Standard** for the [APP_NAME] application. It is designed to turn a codebase from a "black box" into a transparent, agent-ready intelligence hub.

## 1. The Core Philosophy: "Agent-First Knowledge"
The documentation is not just for humans; it is the **source of truth** for AI Agents.
- **Predictability:** Every piece of logic has a dedicated home.
- **Traceability:** Code and documentation are linked via standardized paths.
- **Context over Code:** Docs explain *why* and *how* something connects, rather than just repeating the code.

---

## 2. Folder Taxonomy (The Library Structure)

The library is organized into **two top-level libraries** based on functional purpose:

### 📖 Wiki/ — Architecture Knowledge Base

| Directory | Role | Parent/Index File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Wiki/core` | **The Brain** | `00-system-index.md` | Master index, design systems, state context, and global architecture. |
| `Wiki/features` | **The Nervous System** | `features-index.md` | Screen-specific documentation, feature workflows, and view-logic. |
| `Wiki/components` | **The Muscle** | `components-index.md` | Documentation for reusable UI atoms, molecules, and organisms. |
| `Wiki/database` | **The Skeleton** | `database-index.md` | Schema breakdowns, table relationships, and data-layer logic. |
| `Wiki/logic` | **The Internal Organs**| `logic-index.md` | Utility functions, custom hooks, and complex algorithmic explanations. |

### ⚙️ DevOps/ — Operational Process Tooling

| Directory | Role | Parent/Index File | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `DevOps/logs` | **The Memory** | `agent-changelog.md` | Chronological records of agent actions, audits, and hygiene checks. |
| `DevOps/backlog` | **The Queue** | `backlog-index.md` | Project backlog index and individual backlog plan files. |
| `DevOps/plans` | **The Vision** | *(User Managed)* | Implementation plans, architectural RFCs, and feature roadmaps. |
| `DevOps/archive-plans` | **The Archive** | `README.md` | Completed and closed implementation plans. |
| `DevOps/prompts` | **The Voice** | *(User Managed)* | Standardized LLM prompts and persona definitions for consistency. |

---

## 3. Naming Conventions (The Prefix Pattern)

To ensure high-speed lookup and clarity, files within subdirectories must follow specific prefix patterns:

- **Core:** `0x-name.md` (Numbered sequence for onboarding flow).
- **Features:** `feat-feature-name.md` (e.g., `feat-assembly-builder.md`).
- **Components:** `ui-component-name.md` (e.g., `ui-modal.md`).
- **Database:** `db-table-name.md` (e.g., `db-projects.md`).
- **Logic:** `util-logic-name.md` or `hook-name.md`.
- **Plans:** `DevOps/plans/name-plan.md`.
- **Backlog:** `DevOps/backlog/<feature-slug>-backlog.md`.

---

## 4. Standard Document Anatomy

Every `.md` file in the library should adhere to this structure:

### A. YAML Frontmatter
```yaml
---
type: "feature" | "component" | "database" | "logic" | "core"
name: "Human Readable Name"
status: "stable" | "in-progress" | "deprecated"
dependencies: ["feat-auth", "db-projects"]
db_relations: ["projects", "assemblies"]
description: "Brief summary of the document purpose."
---
```

### B. Header & Summary
A clear H1 followed by a 2-3 sentence overview of the subject.

### C. Technical Context (The "What")
- **Physical Path:** Explicit path to the code (`src/views/...`).
- **Data Shape:** JSON or TypeScript definitions of relevant state.
- **Mermaid Diagrams:** Use flowcharts or sequence diagrams to visualize logic.

### D. Relationships (The "How it Connects")
Links to related database tables, parent indices, or sibling features.

---

## 5. The "Hub & Spoke" Linking Strategy

- **The Hub:** `Wiki/core/00-system-index.md` acts as the master router. It links to all **Category Indices** in the Wiki, and also cross-links to DevOps operational directories.
- **The Spokes:** Each Wiki category (`Wiki/features/`, `Wiki/database/`, `Wiki/logic/`, `Wiki/components/`) has its own `*-index.md` that lists its children.
- **DevOps Cross-Links:** The hub also links out to `DevOps/backlog/`, `DevOps/plans/`, `DevOps/logs/`, and `DevOps/archive-plans/`.
- **Cross-Links:** Individual docs link directly to their database schemas or utility dependencies.

---

## 6. The Lifecycle of Documentation

1. **Planning:** A plan file is created in `DevOps/plans/`.
2. **Execution:** The agent performs the work and logs it in `DevOps/logs/agent-changelog.md`.
3. **Sync:** As code is committed, the corresponding `feat-*`, `ui-*`, or `db-*` docs in `Wiki/` are updated to reflect the new truth.
4. **Archiving:** Deprecated features move to a `deprecated/` subfolder or are marked in frontmatter. Completed plans move from `DevOps/plans/` to `DevOps/archive-plans/`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Golden Rule:** If a feature's behavior changes in code, the documentation MUST be updated in the same PR/Conversation. Outdated documentation is technical debt.
