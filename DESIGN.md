## 🎨 Creative North Star

Every application should follow a clean, premium, and unified aesthetic guidelines. Key principles include:

- **Unified Color Palette:** Use HSL or hex tokens mapped to theme variables to manage dark/light modes and custom components.
- **Architectural Layout:** Leverage consistent spacing scales, structured grid alignments, and component boundaries.
- **Visual Boundaries:** Define section separations cleanly. Avoid over-using hard borders; instead, utilize backgrounds, elevation shadows, or subtle padding offsets.
