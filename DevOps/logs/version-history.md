# Version History & Policy

This log records the formal releases, deployments, and the 3-level versioning strategy enforced across the [APP_NAME] environment.

## 📌 Versioning Strategy (3-Level System)

All versioning follows the semantic hierarchy configured within the `/Test-and-Deploy` pipeline:

1. **Level 1 (Major)**: User-directed primary versions (e.g., `1.02.003` -> `2.00.000`). Triggered for fundamental architectural updates, paradigm shifts, or major product milestones. Resets both minor and patch levels to double/triple zero padding.
2. **Level 2 (Minor)**: New feature versions (e.g., `1.02.003` -> `1.03.003`). Adds `.01` to Level 2 versioning (allowing up to 99 level 2 versions), while preserving the patch level as-is. Prompted and confirmed when introducing discrete new features, capabilities, or major screen flows.
3. **Level 3 (Patch)**: Automated deployment versions (e.g., `1.02.003` -> `1.02.004`). Adds `.001` to Level 3 versioning (allowing up to 999 level 3 versions), while preserving the minor level as-is. Automatically bumped on every routine code deployment or patch push if no major/minor bump is specified.
